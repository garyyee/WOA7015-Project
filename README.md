## Problem Statement
Heart and respiratory rates are crucial clinical indicators in monitoring a personâ€™s health status, especially the neonates. The common methods of measuring heart rate in neonates are electrocardiography (ECG) and pulse oximetry, which are intrusive methods. 

## Objective
To investigate the feasibility of estimating heart rate in neonates using respiratory signals, as a non-intrusive alternative to ECG and pulse oximetry.
